# DIY_Arduino_E-Scooter
This repository is for my Hackster project on how to build an e-scooter with Arduino!

Tutorial can be found here:

## Explanation of files

The "DIY_E-Scooter Libraries.zip" file is a compressed file of all the libaries used in this project.  If using the Arduino Cloud, just import this one file in the libraries section, and you will have no issues at all!

The "diy_e-scooter" folder has the "diy_e-scooter.ino" sketch in it, which is the entire code for this project currently.  This code runs without any WiFi or wireless activity.  A new version is coming soon that includes WiFi using the Arduino Cloud!

# Updates
There will be more updates coming after further testing!  This is only the first version.

WS2812 LEDs will become finalized for turning signals, brake light, etc.
